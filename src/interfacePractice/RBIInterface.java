package interfacePractice;

//Interface can have only abstract methods.
//Means we can not implement any methods or put body for an method in interface
//We can declare variables in interface
//We can not create Object for Interface because it only has Abstract methods. Also we can create object only for classes not for interfaces
//If a class wants to inherit the property of an Interface, we need to use "implements" keywords.
//Whenever a class implements an interface, it will force us to implement all the unimplemented methods in our class

//We can not create a static abstract method in an interface
//Interface let us to have methods with body but those methods should be either static or default method
//We can have static method in interface but we cannot use it in any implemented class
//We can access default method in implemented class by using object
